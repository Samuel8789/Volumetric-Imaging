# Volumetric-Imaging
SLM (spatial light modulator) control for volumetric imaging in two-photon laser scanning microscope

Use "ImagingControl.m" for volumetric imaging system (see instruction in the opening section of the file).

To measure aberration and create correction masks, see details in folder "AdaptiveOptics".

This progrom controls SLM for volumetric imaging, and should be run in parallel with ScanImage. To control ETL (electrically tunable lens), one can use the built-in function in ScanImage.
